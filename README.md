# InstagramBot
Influencers don't get time for posting same thing over different social media handles. So this 4 line code does job for instagram.

#This is a very basic bot, post only one post at time

Just go to your terminal and run the command 
$ python bot.py
and just wait for seconds and post is done!

Check the master branch for code

Before writing the code install "instabot library"

use $pip install instabot
// wait for few seconds and after installation you can write your code in your local environment.
