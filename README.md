# InstagramBot
Influencers don't get time for posting same thing over different social media handles. So this 4 line code does job for instagram.

# This is a very basic bot, single post at time

Just go to your terminal and run the command 
$ python bot.py
and just wait for seconds and post is done!

Check the master branch for code

Before writing the code install "instabot library"

use $pip install instabot
// wait for few seconds and after installation you can write your code in your local environment.

# Run in your terminal (linux or mac) and command prompt (windows)
$ python bot.py

wait for 30 secs or till then you can work somewhere, it is posted 

# For every new use delete the "config" folder created previously
